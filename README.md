# Grouping of Spain provinces based on socio-economic data

We will be working with a database of socio-economic information from the provinces of Spain. Our project involves conducting an exploratory analysis, calculating covariance and correlation matrices both numerically and graphically to identify linearly correlated variables.

Next, we will analyze the principal components to determine how many components are necessary to explain the data and its variances. Subsequently, we will project the data onto the selected components and analyze similarities between the variables and the data (provinces) both numerically and graphically.

Once we have transformed the data, we will begin using various clustering algorithms such as single cluster, complete cluster, and ward cluster. We will then search for the optimal number of clusters through different criteria and finally apply the K-means algorithm to identify groups of provinces.
